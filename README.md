Shell readability checks that sit beside ShellCheck.

ShellCheck should own correctness, portability, quoting, and shell semantics. This project focuses on reviewability: control-flow depth, operator-heavy expressions, long functions, function-first script shape, defaulted function args, repeated comparisons, direct shell smoke tests, and patterns that make scripts harder to scan.

Requires Bash 4.3 or newer. ShellCheck is a development lint dependency, not a runtime dependency.

## Install

```sh
brew tap yowainwright/shellcheck_readability
brew install --HEAD shellcheck-readability
```

<!-- comment rule behavior from lib/rules.bash and lib/lint.bash -->

<a id="no-unmatched-comments"></a>

### `no-unmatched-comments`

Reject comments that do not match a configured regular-expression matcher, prefix identifier, or suffix identifier.

Shebangs, ShellCheck directives, and `noqa` directives are ignored. No matcher or identifier is configured by default, so selecting this rule directly rejects ordinary comments.

#### options

- `comment-matchers`: case-insensitive Bash regular expressions matched anywhere in the comment body. Default: `[]`.
- `comment-prefix-identifiers`: case-insensitive literal identifiers matched at the start of the trimmed comment body. Default: `[]`.
- `comment-suffix-identifiers`: case-insensitive literal identifiers matched at the end of the trimmed comment body. Default: `[]`.

<a id="no-unmatched-comments-diff"></a>

#### do / don't

```diff
- # explain this branch
+ require_target
```

With `KEEP` as an allowed prefix identifier:

```diff
- # preserve the legacy response order
+ # KEEP: preserve the legacy response order
```

---

<a id="no-automated-comment-attribution"></a>

### `no-automated-comment-attribution`

Reject explicit automated authorship and generation signatures in comments. Ordinary references to the configured technologies are unchanged.

#### options

- `automated-comment-identifiers`: case-insensitive names treated as automated sources. Default: `ai`, `chatgpt`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `gpt`, `llm`, and `openai`.

<a id="no-automated-comment-attribution-diff"></a>

#### do / don't

```diff
- # <configured identifier>-generated.
+ retry_in_provider_order
```

Structured `@author` tags and phrases such as `generated by <identifier>` or `<identifier>-generated` are rejected. Unmarked prose is not classified.

---

<a id="no-stacked-comments"></a>

### `no-stacked-comments`

Report the second and subsequent comments on consecutive lines. A blank or non-comment line breaks the stack. Shebangs, ShellCheck directives, and `noqa` directives are ignored.

This rule has no options.

<a id="no-stacked-comments-diff"></a>

#### do / don't

```diff
- # Retry every failed request.
  # Retry requests that fail during regional failover.
```

## Recipes

The comment rules are explicit policy opt-ins and are excluded from broad selectors. Put the policy in a supported RC, YAML, or TOML file and select the rules directly by code or name.

```yaml
select: [LEG, LEG041, LEG042, LEG043]
comment-matchers:
  - '(^|[^[:alnum:]_])(ENG|OPS)-[0-9]+([^[:alnum:]_]|$)'
comment-prefix-identifiers: [KEEP]
comment-suffix-identifiers: ["@keep"]
```

This rejects unmarked comments, explicit automated attribution, and adjacent comments. Configure identifiers only for established repository conventions; do not add a marker solely to make a new comment pass.

Use `--exit-zero` for advisory feedback. Enforcement should use the same committed configuration without `--exit-zero`.

## Use

```sh
bin/shellcheck-readability check scripts tests
bin/shellcheck-readability check . --select LEG001,LEG002 --ignore LEG038
bin/shellcheck-readability check . --output-format json
```

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from the first matching file found while searching upward:

- `.shellcheck-readabilityrc` with `key=value` or `key: value` assignments.
- `.shellcheck-readability.yml` or `.shellcheck-readability.yaml` with YAML mappings and inline or block lists.
- `shellcheck-readability.toml` or `.shellcheck-readability.toml` with TOML assignments.

```toml
max-expression-operators = 4
max-if-operators = 0
max-control-flow-depth = 3
max-function-lines = 20
min-case-chain-length = 3
min-object-lookup-chain-length = 3
min-dirname-match-depth = 3
comment-matchers = []
comment-prefix-identifiers = []
comment-suffix-identifiers = []
automated-comment-identifiers = ["ai", "chatgpt", "claude", "codex", "copilot", "gemini", "gpt", "llm", "openai"]
```

Selectors use the same model as the other legibility tools: `select`, `ignore`, rule codes, rule names, and `LEG`.
Comment rules are policy opt-ins and are excluded from the broad `LEG` and `all` selectors.

## Rule Function Testing

Rule functions are named after the lint checks and accept optional values, so tests can call them directly:

```sh
check_hoist_if_operators "example.sh" "4" 'if [[ -n "$user" && -n "$email" ]]; then'
check_max_expression_operators "example.sh" "7" 'build && test && package'
check_no_bool_literal_args "example.sh" "9" 'create_user "$name" true false'
check_prefer_functions "example.sh" "5" "docker build ."
check_use_defaults_in_functions "example.sh" "6" 'local target="$1"'
check_no_unmatched_comments "example.sh" "4" "# explain this branch"
check_no_automated_comment_attribution "example.sh" "4" "# Generated by Codex."
check_no_stacked_comments "example.sh" "4" "# First comment."
check_no_stacked_comments "example.sh" "5" "# Second comment."
```

## Tests

```sh
make unit
make e2e
make check
```
